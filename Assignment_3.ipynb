    "    Functions  provide several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modularity: Functions allow us to break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces. Each function can perform a specific task, making the code more modular and easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reuseability: Once a function is defined, it can be reused in different parts of the program or even in different programs. This promotes code reuse, saving time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Readability: Functions enhance code readability by encapsulating complex operations or logic behind a simple interface. This makes the main program more readable and easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: Functions allow us  to abstract away the implementation details and focus on the higher-level functionality. Users of the function only need to know how to use it, not how it's implemented."
